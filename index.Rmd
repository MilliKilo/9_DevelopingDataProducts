## Introduction

This shiny application allows an user to design their dream car and then predict the mileage in Miles per Gallon (MPG) 
for their dream car.

---

## Application Logic


```{r}
fit <- train(mpg ~ cyl+disp+hp+wt+am, method = "glm", data = mtcars)

result <- function(cyl,disp,hp,wt,am) {
  s <- cbind(cyl,disp,hp,wt,am)
  res <- predict(fit,s)
  as.character(res)
}
```

## Application Inputs (via GUI)

The user can select any or all of the following inputs to customize their car:

. Cylinder

. Displacement

. Horsepower

. Weight

. Automatic or Manual


---
## Application Prediction

output$prediction <- renderPrint({result(input$variable1,input$variable2,input$variable3,input$variable4,input$variable5)})

## Application Prediction
This is a screenshot of the deployed shiny application. It was tested and worked for various combinations of numeric inputs. Feel free to give it a try!
